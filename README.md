( credit 2 my friend for helping me create this. )

ദ്ദി‎◍˃ ᵕ ˂◍)

 hi! Call me Seven, Abel, or Loki! 
 
 most likely i prefer my most common name (Seven/Abel) though. 
 
 Pleased to meet you, I enjoy spending my time on ponytown, which is where you most likely just found me.

            a few things!! 
            
  i block/hide without given warning, nor do you need an explanation as to WHY I am blocking you. Trust me, you'll live.

  i do not do the concept of mutuals, my list is reserved for people i actually have know, thank you.

  Please be patient with me, as i am usual a busy person and may not respond immediately if i don't know you well.

  Refrain from interacting with me if you are below 15, unless you are already my friend.

  Please note!! i may come off as rude or i forget the use of tonetags, please just remind me or if you need them! Thank you.

  DO NOT talk to me if I have unfriended you, it was for a good reason, the world will keep spinning without me. iassure you. 
  THOUGH! i do tend to occasionally empty my list of anyone i do NOT remember. If you see me, dont be scared just ask if I remember you!!

  i tend to get violent spurrs, i'd prefer you be on extreme caution when this happens. i will not hold back anything, and mostly come off as rude. 


  [ PLEASE DO NOTE. ] i don't have any form of OSDD | ODD. i simply just like to refer myself as characters i enjoy and kin. Thank you.
